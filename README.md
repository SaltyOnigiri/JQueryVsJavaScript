# JQueryVsJavaScript
A lab that shows two sites that do the same thing. One using only JavaScript and the other utilizing JQuery. The site itself is crazy basic and should do the following things:
1. An h1 heading
2. A form containing:
 - Labels and text input fields shown
 - A button (create this as a generic input button using <input
type=”button”> not as a submit button b/c you are not submitting the
form to a script for processing)
3. An inline image of your choice

Using JavaScript/JQuery:
1. When the user clicks the button:
  - The color of the body should be set to the color specified in
the “favorite color” text box
  - The color of all input fields except the button should be
changed to the color specified in the “next favorite color” text box
(note: this should be done without adding class attributes and in such
a way that any text boxes added to the form will automatically also
change colors w/o needing to modify the JavaScript code)
  - The “favorite number” should be displayed that many times
on the screen below the image
2. When the user mouses over the image, a different image of your
choice should replace the original image. The 2 images should alternate with
every mouseover.

_Lab1_
- Shows the website using solely JavaScript

_Lab2_
- Shows the same website using JQuery and JavaScript
